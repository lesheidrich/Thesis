\chapter{Introduction}
In todayâ€™s world, data has become of paramount importance, profoundly influencing our lives and shaping decision making processes. The acquisition, processing, and interpretation of data is fundamental across multiple domains. \cite{Mondaut} Recognized as the cornerstone of contemporary insights, data serves as the basis of deriving valuable insights, and making informed projections, thereby guiding strategic planning and allowing for suitable preparation in the face of uncertainty. However, utilizing the full potential of acquired information effectively in a complex, multi-variable dynamic environment can be a challenging task \cite{Kornwitz}.

This thesis approaches data collection and forecasting from a sports analytical perspective, aiming to derive statistical insights and formulate projections regarding future performance. It endeavors to utilize a combination of web scarping techniques \cite{Khder} and Monte Carlo simulation \cite{Aderibigbe} for analytical forecasting. Through the integration of these techniques, this research aims to explore a comprehensive methodology for data acquisition and predictive modeling.

\section{Contextual Background}
The National Basketball Association (NBA) \cite{NBA} is well known for its worldwide prominence and dedicated fan base. Its enduring popularity has resulted in a multitude of analytical data relating to historic games. This abundance of statistical data, along with a widespread general awareness of the sport and my personal enthusiasm for it, positions historic NBA games an ideal domain for exploring predictive modeling based on data obtained through web scraping.

\section{Motivation}
The incentive for this research is derived from a keen interest in the technical intricacies of web scraping and probabilistic elegance of Monte Carlo simulations. The application of these techniques transcends the domain of sports analytics, with uses in finance \cite{McLeish}, physics \cite{Aderibigbe}, and beyond \cite{Steffen}.

\section{Objectives}
The primary objective of this thesis is two-fold. Initially, to employ web scarping techniques to gather comprehensive historical NBA game data from the early 1990s. Subsequently, to utilize said data to simulate a general probabilistic outcome for selected historic NBA games.

Specifically, the research aims to:
\begin{itemize}
\item Develop a multi-approach web scraping pipeline to gather comprehensive historical data for a given NBA season and team.
\item Manage and store the acquired data.
\item Implement a multi-epoch Monte Carlo simulation to model potential game outcomes based on the attained data through modeling offensive possessions.
\item Evaluate the predictive accuracy and reliability of the proposed methodology through empirical testing and validation against actual historic game results.
\end{itemize}
Through these objectives, this thesis undertakes to promote a deeper understanding of web scraping and predictive modeling within sports analytical forecasting.

\chapter{Requirements}

\section{Requirements List}
The system shall be constructed to uniquely fulfill both the requirements of a computer science thesis, and the domain of data acquisition and simulation based projections. It should therefore result in an intuitive end-user experience, leveraging the web scraping and Monte Carlo simulation methodologies explored in this thesis.

The client interface should allow users to interact with the business logic\footnote{The term refers to the collection of algorithms responsible for allocating and processing data through communication with the database in order to serve the user interface, while maintaining its independence from both. For further information, please see \cite{Booch}.}, thereby accessing the database through built-in functions. It should also allow for the utilization of web scraping and Monte Carlo methodologies. The Use Case diagram depicted below outlines the basic functionality described by the Functional - (see table {\ref{table-funct-req}}), Non-Functional - (see table {\ref{table-non-funct-req}}), and Platform Requirements (see table {\ref{table-platform-req}}) outlined in this chapter.

\subsection{Use Cases}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Game Selection}: The user selects parameters such as the desired season, home- and away team, to initialize game selection, then chooses the desired match from the returned table. 
	\item \textbf{Validation}: After accidentally setting a team to play against themselves, the user receives an error message alerting them of the mistake.
	\item \textbf{Scraping}: Following the game selection process, the system determines the game data is not in the database, then proceeds to utilize web scraping techniques to gather the data from online sources. 
	\item \textbf{Simulation}: A user parameterizes the number of epochs for the Monte Carlo simulation and initializes game selection. The system utilizes the acquired historical data to run simulations, generating probabilistic outcomes for the historic NBA game.
	\item \textbf{Comparison}: Users compare the results of the Monte Carlo simulation with the original game data, assessing the accuracy of the model. The system further provides probability density- and violin graphs to further facilitate result analysis.
	\item \textbf{Error Handling}: When the user tries to initialize game selection, the database is down. The host service returns an error, notifying the user of the access issue. The user escalates the error, and upon its resolution normal system operations resume.
\end{itemize}



\chapter{Architecture}

\section{Design Concepts}
At its core, the application relies heavily on a three principal layer \cite[p.~19]{Fowler} concept, commonly found in systems utilizing a database and presentation layer. Fowler refers to these as presentation logic, domain logic, and data source. The presentation logic facilitates user interaction with the system, the data source handles data transactions and houses application information, while the domain logic's algorithms are responsible for data modification and layer interaction. 

This is in line with the Gang-of-Four's \footnote{The Gang of Four \cite{GOF2} (GOF) are a group of four writers, all computer science professionals and entrepreneurs. Their literature and courses focus on professional development in the domain of computer science.} Model-View-Controller (MVC) \cite[p.~529]{GOF} design pattern. The View receives user-initiated interactions along with their parameters, and presents the application's data. It is capable of connecting directly to the model, while operating in conjunction with the Controller. The Controller interacts with both components as it processes their data and coordinates operations. The Model houses and manages the application data.

As discussed by Ahlan, A. R., Ahrnud, M. B., and Arshad, Y. \cite{Kulliyyah}, there have been several uses and variations of thin client applications since the 1970s. As a generalization, the \emph{view} in its capacity as the client receives application data and logic based services from a host system. This application adheres to the this concept quite strictly, with the client acting as an intermediary between the user and the host, taking use parameters and displaying host response results. The host service encompasses the previously discussed Model, Controller and all other components of the application.


\section{Components}
Following the MVC design pattern's component structure, the application's presentation logic is allocated to the \emph{view} package. The database and simple business logic allowing for record management is stored in the \emph{model}. Acting as an intermediary between the two, the \emph{controller} package orchestrates the flow of information along with its processing. The \emph{webscraper} and \emph{simulator} packages also tie into the \emph{controller}, offering web scraping, and Monte Carlo simulation logic respectively, while further decoupling the application's components and allowing for better organization and maintainability through separation of concerns \footnote{Separation of concerns (SoC) is a software development design principle promoting segregation of source code elements by functionality in order to improve readability, organization and modification \cite{Reade}.}.

The application is organized in a manner, that all components embody system packages allowing improved readability and usability. The following subsections discuss each package's purpose and functionality.


\subsection{\emph{view}}
\paragraph{Purpose:}
To allow for user interaction with the system through communication with the host along with its application logic and data.

\paragraph{Functionality:}
The view package operates as a thin client, taking user input through a graphic user interface (GUI) \cite{Wiki-GUI}. User data is cached on the client side for the sake of user convenience, decreasing the input required to achieve functionality. Host responses, along with operational errors are displayed for user viewing. Errors are not logged on the client side of the application.

\paragraph{Interaction:}
The component interacts with the user and the host module of the \emph{controller} package.



\subsection{\emph{controller}}
\paragraph{Purpose:}
The package is responsible for processing component interaction, and serves as the core logic of the system.

\paragraph{Functionality:}
Serving as the system's host, the \emph{controller} is responsible for handling user prompts sent by the client in order to formulate an appropriate response. In order to fulfill this function it utilizes its connection to each component of the application, accessing their functionality as needed.

One of its responsibilities is accumulating data through the application of various web scraping methods, which are stored for future use. It's web scraper control functionality enables it to utilize the \emph{webscraper} package to appropriate preset website data into memory, then reallocate it to the database using a combination of its own control processes along with the business logic of the \emph{model} package. The web scraping sequence diagram illustrates the process (see {\ref{img-scraping-sequence}}).

When running a simulation for a parameterized game, the \emph{controller} restructures relevant data for the selected historic games from the \emph{model} into player, roster, and team objects usable by the \emph{simulator}. The simulator returns the results to the host, which are forwarded back to the client. The Monte Carlo simulation sequence diagram shows further details (see {\ref{img-monte-carlo-sequence}}).

The \emph{controller's} basic interactions throughout it's operation are depicted in the package's component diagram (see{\ref{img-controller-component}}).

\paragraph{Interaction:}

Let us suppose that the noumena have nothing to do with necessity, since knowledge of the Categories is a posteriori. Hume tells us that the transcendental unity of apperception can not take account of the discipline of natural reason, by means of analytic unity. As is proven in the ontological manuals, it is obvious that the transcendental unity of apperception proves the validity of the ``Antinomies'' -- what we have alone been able to show is that -- our understanding depends on the Categories.
\cite[p.~102]{Knuth}

It remains a mystery why the Ideal stands in need of reason. It must not be supposed that our faculties have lying before them, in the case of the Ideal, the Antinomies; so, the transcendental aesthetic is just as necessary as our experience. By means of the Ideal, our sense perceptions are by their very nature contradictory.
